This project presents an AI-powered surveillance system designed to detect incidents of harassment and molestation in public and private spaces using computer vision and deep learning. The system uses real-time video analysis to identify suspicious or harmful human interactions and sends automated alerts to authorities

- Real-time detection of harassment/molestation activities using AI.
- Build modules for video processing, human posture analysis, and suspicious activity classification.
- Reduce manual monitoring efforts.
- Improve accuracy over existing systems.
- Challenges: Dataset limitations, real-time performance tuning.
